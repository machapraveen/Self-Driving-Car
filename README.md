# Self-Driving Car Simulator Project

This project uses a trained neural network model to autonomously drive a car in the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8
- Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator (available [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim))
- Conda (recommended for environment management)

## Project Structure

```
self-driving-car-sim/
│
├── drive.py
├── model.h5
└── README.md
```

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone [Your Repository URL]
   cd self-driving-car-sim
   ```

2. Create and activate a new conda environment:
   ```
   conda create --name sdcar python=3.8
   conda activate sdcar
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install tensorflow
   pip install opencv-python
   pip install pillow
   pip install python-socketio==4.6.0
   pip install python-engineio==3.13.2
   pip install eventlet
   pip install flask
   ```

4. Ensure that `model.h5` (your trained model) is in the project directory.

## Running the Simulator

1. Start the drive script:
   ```
   python drive.py
   ```

2. Launch the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.

3. Select the track you want to test on.

4. Click the "Autonomous Mode" button.

The car should now start driving autonomously using the trained model.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with conda, try using a virtual environment instead:

1. Create a new virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv sdcar_venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows: `sdcar_venv\Scripts\activate`
   - On macOS and Linux: `source sdcar_venv/bin/activate`

3. Install the required packages as listed in step 3 of the Setup Instructions.

## Model Training

The `model.h5` file was trained using [briefly describe your training process and data]. For details on the model architecture and training process, refer to [link to your training code or documentation].

## Additional Notes

- This project uses TensorFlow and Keras for the neural network model.
- The `drive.py` script interfaces with the Udacity simulator using Socket.IO.
- Ensure your computer meets the system requirements for running the Udacity Self-Driving Car Simulator.
